#  ALX Data Analytics â€“ Preparing Data Module

This repository summarizes my learning journey through the **Preparing Data** module of the ALX Data Analytics program.  
Over several weeks, I worked through theoretical lessons, hands-on spreadsheet practice, and two integrated projects to apply everything I learned.

>  All work in this sprint was completed using **Google Sheets**  
>  Focus: Data cleaning, transformation, analysis, and visualization

##  Module Overview

Throughout the sprint, I explored key data skills:

-  **Data sourcing and importing**
-  **Spreadsheet interface mastery**
-  **Cleaning & transforming raw datasets**
-  **Descriptive statistics** (mean, median, mode, IQR)
-  **Pivot tables, filters & sorting**
-  **Data visualizations** (line, box, stacked, histogram, heatmaps)
-  **Formulas & logic functions** (`IF`, `COUNTA`, `LOOKUP`, `ROUND`, `IFERROR`)
-  **Samples, distributions, and probability**
-  **ARC (Annual Rate of Change) analysis**
-  **Pattern recognition and trend lines**
-  **Accuracy metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE)**
-  **Hypothesis testing (parametric & non-parametric)**

## Integrated Projects

| Project | Description | Link |
|--------|-------------|------|
| **Part 1: Understanding the Data** | Single-year (2020) analysis of global access to drinking water, focusing on basic vs limited vs unimproved access, categorized by income and population type. | [ðŸ”— View Project Repo](https://github.com/MariamRaafatMohamed/G-sheets_Integrated-project_Understanding-the-data) |
| **Part 2: Transforming the Data** | Longitudinal study (2000â€“2020) on access improvements using ARC, highlighting progress by region and population group. | [ðŸ”— View Project Repo](https://github.com/MariamRaafatMohamed/G-sheets_Integrated-project_Transforming-the-Data) |


Both projects were based on real-world datasets from the **WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP)** and executed fully inside Google Sheets.

## What I Learned

This sprint gave me hands-on experience in:

- Cleaning real-world messy datasets
- Structuring and transforming data using formulas
- Using spreadsheet logic to calculate and validate metrics
- Understanding distributions, statistical summaries, and charts
- Deriving trends over time and interpreting long-term progress
- Communicating insights clearly using visuals
