## What I Learned

Through these two projects, I developed hands-on skills in:
- Cleaning and validating real-world datasets
- Using formulas (`IF`, `COUNTA`, `ROUND`, `LOOKUP`, `IFERROR`)
- Creating calculated fields and derived metrics
- Designing visualizations that communicate insights clearly
- Working with multi-year data and comparing trends over time
- Structuring analysis within Google Sheets only â€” without code
